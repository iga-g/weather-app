# Today's Weather

## Description

It's weather app which I made basing on The Net Ninja course. However there is a lot of functionalites and design solutions made by me, such as:
- taking Date data and formatting it by [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) library.
- changing background-color of website (+transitions) dependent on day/night result
- effective input and hover effect on anchors
- new glassy trend on card with some transform effects
- copyright info box which is interactive

Also I wanted to start my road to learning SCSS so I used this project to do it.

## Roadmap

As a development of this project I think I would like to make something like validation on the input to let people know if they enter wrong city name.

Completed for now and it's fully responsive. May have some problems with Safari browser. It's what I'm really trying to fix asap.
